mountall (0.1.2ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * mount.ntfs and mount.ntfs-3g do not support the standard "-n" (no mtab)
    mount option, and error when passed.  Since the ntfs code is rather
    complex, and seems safe against failing to write to mtab, work around
    it in mountall and never pass -n to mount for ntfs and ntfs-3g
    filesystems
